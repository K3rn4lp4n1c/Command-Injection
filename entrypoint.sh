# 2) Put the known sample in uploads but make it immutable to the app user:
# - owned by root
# - read-only

# chattr +i /app/uploads/exiftool_test.png || true

# 3) Drop privileges and run Flask (no reloader so it wonâ€™t try to write files)
exec gosu ctf:ctf python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000 --no-reload
